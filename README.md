Check out [vaughan's gist](https://github.com/hilts-vaughan/hilts-vaughan.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2022-12-16-installing-horizon-xi-linux.md#install-horizonxi---steam-play-steam-deck--other-systems) for the step-by-step instructions if you run into trouble.

### Prerequisites

Set up a memorable sudo password in konsole. i.e.

```
passwd
```

### Installation

This script should:
- see if you don't have the base game downloaded & extracted
- attempt to download/install v1.0.1
- add the steam shortcut
- after files are downloaded & extracted and the steam shortcut added, the next time you launch update-horizon.sh it should upgrade to the latest


Just download this script, and run like so in konsole:

```
./install-or-update-horizon.sh
```

For any update after the first you can copy to your desktop and run it with double click.

### Uninstallation

Beta access: ./uninstall.sh

Please test, and let me know if it works. Try reinstalling with ./update-horizon.sh afterwards to complete the test cycle.
